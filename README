Instructions to Replicate the Experiments

1. Create two VMs on EC2 for Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04
   Choose c1.medium as the instance type. Images for both VMs can be found in Public AMIs as follows.
     Ubuntu 11.10
       [Name] ubuntu/images/ebs/ubuntu-oneiric-11.10-amd64-server-20130203
       [ID]   ami-13ba2d7a
     Ubuntu 12.04
       [Name] ubuntu/images/ebs/ubuntu-precise-12.04-amd64-server-20120424
       [ID]   ami-a29943cb

2. Install Mininet on both new VMs
     sudo apt-get install git curl
     git clone git://github.com/mininet/mininet
     mininet/util/install.sh -a

3. Install and run testing program
     git clone git://github.com/gengyl08/cs244_pa3.git
     cd cs244_pa3
     sudo ./run.sh

4. Interpret the generated graphs
   In each VM, there is a test_output_$timestamp folder. You can find the the following files in it:
     tcp_probe.png: Figure of cwnd of a single flow
     result_loss1.png: Latency at link loss rate of 1%
     result_loss3.png: Latency at link loss rate of 3%
